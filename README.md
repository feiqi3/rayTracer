My work after reading "Ray Tracing in one weekend"
Here is the book [Ray Tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Lots of new features have been added on the origin program in the book.
Until now, the following features have been done:  
- A simple log   
- Triangle rendering   
- Barycentric coordinate  
- .JPG writing based on STBI   
- Texture mapping    
- New render queue  
- Multithreading support  
- .obj model rendering(inefficiency)  
- Light    
- Sky box  
    
TO DO:   
- Importance sampling  
- Accecleration structure
NO plan for:  
The randome scene.  

how to run:  
mkdir build  
cd build   
cmake ..
